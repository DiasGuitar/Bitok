        <h1 class="text-center">Our Story</h1>
        <div class="Story">
            <p>
                In the era of digital technologies and the rapid development of information technologies, a
    company appeared in Kazakhstan that shook traditional ideas about education. Bitok, an
    abbreviation of "Bits of Knowledge," was created by Dias and Alibek, two prominent
    information technology specialists who shared a burning desire to make knowledge accessible
    to everyone. Their slogan, "Better with us," became not just the company's motto, but a
    promise for those who were looking for high-quality IT education in Kazakhstan.
            </p>
            <p>
                The history of Bitok began with a dream. Dias and Alibek were convinced that education in the
    field of information technology should be accessible to everyone who aspires to master these
    valuable skills, it should not be the privilege of a few. They believed in the power of online
    education, and their dream was to create a platform that would make IT education accessible
    and effective for everyone
            </p>
            <p>
                The first steps were not easy, but with great passion and determination, Dias and Alibek set
    about creating Bitok. Their team consisted of only two talented specialists in the field of
    information technology. They worked day and night to create unique educational materials that
    would allow students to delve into the world of IT.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bitok was not an ordinary online platform. It was a place where students could fully immerse
    themselves in the atmosphere of learning. The design of the website was modern, beautiful and
    at the same time had no distracting components, which allowed Bitok students to fully
    concentrate on learning. In addition, Bitok provides not only theoretical knowledge, but also
    gives students the opportunity to practice and solve real problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                The word about Bitok spread quickly on the web and Alen and Aybar became one of the first
    Bitok users. Alen was a student who dreamed of working in the field of web development and
    Bitok gave him this great opportunity. Aybar dreamed of linking his career in the field of
    blockchain and Bitok also managed to realize his dream.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bitok not only provided students with access to high-quality educational materials, but also
    created a community of like-minded people. Students exchanged experiences, asked each other
    questions and solved problems together. A forum was created where everyone could find an
    answer to their question and share their knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                Artificial intelligence was another important component of Bitok. The learning monitoring and
    adaptation system allowed each student to study at their own pace and focus on what is most
    important to them. If someone was experiencing difficulties, the system offered additional
    materials and training resources.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bitok was also committed to the idea of accessibility of education, as it provided an extensive
    package of financial assistance so that even those who had limited funds could receive highquality education in the field of information and communication technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the years, Bitok continued to develop and grow, as the team not only added new courses
    covering the most relevant areas of IT, but also introduced the latest technologies into the educational process. They pioneered the use of augmented reality to create educational
    laboratories, as well as blockchain to verify the authenticity of certificates.
            </p>
            <p>
                Their story has become an example of how passion, dedication and innovation can change the
    educational environment. Bitok has made IT education accessible, interesting and effective, and
    this has had a positive impact on the lives of thousands of students.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today Bitok continues its mission work, making the world of IT accessible to everyone who
    dreams of owning this knowledge. Their story is the story of education transforming lives and
    opening doors to the future.
